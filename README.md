We decided to build a mobile application for our customers, so that they can order our products using their phones. Your goal is to build the backend for this application. 


### Requirements 
* Customers may exchange their username and password for an authentication token
* Customers may see a paginated list of products. Each product in the list should have the following details: `id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity in stock`
* Customers may order the products they need
* Number of products in stock should decrease after an order is made
* Customers may see their history of orders.
